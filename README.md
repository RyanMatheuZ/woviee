### About
Woviee is a personal project, created for a college exam. The project is a social network.

### Features
- Mobile browser-focused design (optional desktop version)
- Login screen with email and password
- Feed containing multiple posts
- When clicking on the image of a post, it must be opened in a modal
- Comments area
- Format of each post:
-- Image
-- Descriptive text
-- Comments

### Observations
- It is allowed to use Javascript/CSS frameworks and libraries
- Data does not need to be persisted to database or across sessions
- All data (user, posts, comments) can be mocked
 - Functionality and code quality are more important than appearance

### Technologies
- HTML 5
- Bulma 0.9.3
- Vue.js 2
- Nuxt 2.15.7

### Integrations
- **Buefy**: Is a user interface component library made on top of  Vue.js  and  Bulma; two  _fresh_, but well-known, frameworks. Buefy has two core principles: 1. keep stuff simple and 2. be lightweight.
We like to think that Buefy is the javascript layer for your Bulma interface, since it doesn't require for it to be a sophisticated Single-Page Application. You can import it completely or single components on a ordinary webpage and use Vue.js as a replacement for jQuery. (https://buefy.org/)
